    "# Emissions Intensity Scheme (EIS) Parameter Selection\n",
    "This notebook describes a mathematical framework for selecting EIS parameters. Please be aware of the following key assumptions underlying this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generators bid into the market at their short-run marginal cost (SRMC);\n",
    "* the market for electricity is perfectly competitive;\n",
    "* the policy maker is able to directly control the emissions intensity baseline and permit price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps taken to conduct the analysis:\n",
    "1. Import packages and declare declare paths to files\n",
    "2. Load data\n",
    "3. Organise data\n",
    "6. Construct model used to select EIS parameters. The model consists of three blocks of equations:\n",
    " * Primal block - contains constraints related to a standard DCOPF model;\n",
    " * Dual block - dual constraints associated with dual program of standard DCOPF model;\n",
    " * Strong duality constraint block - block of constraints linking primal and dual objectives.\n",
    "7. Run DCOPF model to find business-as-usual emissions and wholesale prices.\n",
    "8. Run model used to select EIS parameters, save output\n",
