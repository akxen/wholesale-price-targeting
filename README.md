# Wholesale price targeting via refunded emissions payments
This notebook contains code which implements a mathematical program used to calibrate an output-based emissions abatement policy. Specifically, the program determines values for permit prices and the sectoral emissions intensity baseline that yields given environmental and economic objectives. A derivation of the mathematical program is given in `mppdc_derivation.pdf` within the `derviation` folder.
